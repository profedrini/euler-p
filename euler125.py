'''Problem 125
The palindromic number 595 is interesting because it can be written as the sum of consecutive squares: 6^2 + 7^2 + 8^2 +  9^2 + 10^2 + 11^2 + 12^2.

There are exactly eleven palindromes below one-thousand that can be written as consecutive square sums, and the sum of these palindromes is 4164. Note that 1 = 02 + 12 has not been included as this problem is concerned with the squares of positive integers.

Find the sum of all the numbers less than 10^8 that are both palindromic and can be written as the sum of consecutive squares.

'''NOTAS:
Si el mayor n√∫mero es 10^8 y es suma de al menos dos cuadrados: a^2+b^2 entonces, 
suponiendo a <  b tenemos 2b^2 < 10^8 y por tanto b < 10^4/sqrt(2) < 10^4 / 1.414 < 7073

Por tanto una cota superior es 7073.

Por otro lado

a^2+ (a+1)^2 + ... + (b-1)^2 + (b)^2 = [b(b+1)(2b+1) - (a-1)(a)(2*(a-1)+1]/6
